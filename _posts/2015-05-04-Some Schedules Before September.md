## The Words Before

   Anyway, I got the ticket for a master study in SJTU's CS department. And, the four months I own is extremly precious. I set some specify goals for me in these months, and as a inspiration, I put it on this blog as the first one of this series.
    
   Also, before finding a more effective way to record the knowledge, I will continue to use github.io as home to recore and share what I learn and what I consider. Take a gradtitude for your support!
